yesterday

yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
now it look as though they're here to stay,
oh, I believe in yesterday.

suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
there's a shadow hanging over me,
oh, yesterday, came suddenly.

why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
now I need a place to hide away,
oh, I believe in yesterday.

why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
now I need a place to hide away,
oh, I believe in yesterday.

help!

help, I need somebody,
help, not just anybody,
help, you know I need someone, help.

when I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
but now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

help me if you can, I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you being round.
help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me?

and now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
my independence seems to vanish in the haze.
but every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

help me if you can, I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you being round.
help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me.

let it be

when I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
and in my hour of darkness
she is standing right in front of me
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
let it be, let it be.
whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

and when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree,
there will be an answer, let it be.
for though they may be parted there is
still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer, let it be.
let it be, let it be. Yeah
there will be an answer, let it be.

and when the night is cloudy,
there is still a light that shines on me,
shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
let it be, let it be.
there will be an answer, let it be.
let it be, let it be,
whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
